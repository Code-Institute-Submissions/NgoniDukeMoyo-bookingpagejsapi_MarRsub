## Typography
The Exo font family is the main font used throughout the whole website with San Serif as the fallback font incase the font isnt being imported into the site correctly.
I chose the font "Exo" because of its simplicity but neat impression which compliments the aim of the website itself.


## Imagery

The large heading image backed by the dsscription is designed to automatically prompt the viewer about the design, colors and idea of the space. 

The header and navbar provide clear and simple info to make it as quick and easy interaction.
